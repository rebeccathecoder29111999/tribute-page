                <h4> Early Childhood of APJ Abdul Kalam:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>APJ Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, a small town 
                    in Tamil Nadu, India. He was born into a Tamil Muslim family, and his father, 
                    Jainulabdeen, was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, while his mother, 
                    Ashiamma, was a homemaker.</li>
                    <li>Abdul Kalam's early education took place at the Schwartz Higher Secondary 
                    School in Ramanathapuram. Despite his family's financial constraints, he was a 
                    diligent and bright student. After completing his schooling, Kalam went on to 
                    study aeronautical engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT). 
                    He graduated in 1954 and began working for the Aeronautical Development Establishment 
                    of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</li>
                    <li>Later, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and played a 
                    pivotal role in India's space program. His educational journey continued with a 
                    master's degree in aerospace engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, 
                    Bangalore, and he pursued further studies at the National Aeronautics and Space 
                    Administration (NASA) in the United States.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam's educational background, coupled with his innate curiosity and passion 
                    for science and technology, laid the foundation for his illustrious career as a 
                    scientist and engineer. His journey from a small town in Tamil Nadu to becoming the
                    President of India reflects a remarkable trajectory of dedication, hard work, and a 
                    commitment to advancing India's technical and psycological capabilities.</li>
